### 1. Recreate Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts or on a Napkin.
- Create conceptual diagram to communicate the architecture to key stakeholders. [lucid.app link](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/528e2147-f727-422f-b5d2-7781c6539b58/edit?invitationId=inv_0b9d5529-b1f3-4ece-ae44-06c6bfce333f)

### 2. Recreate Logical Architectual Diagram in Lucid Charts.
- Create logical digram to communicate the broad strokes  of the technical architecture to engineers. [lucid.app link](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/a732e814-2839-48ee-9ddd-7fd5d9593d1a/edit?invitationId=inv_cb5556ca-c556-4848-ba34-02e9ad45cdb6)
